## INDESIGN
**Stack Words**
* Stack words by splitting by <space> character & adding a newline. Great for skinny bubbles!

**Stack Words by 2**
* Stack words into 2 words wide paragraphs. Also includes keeping a long word on a single line only. You can modify the `longWordLength` variable in the script to whatever amount of character length you decide is "too long" for your bubble.

**Extract Fontlist (extract_fontlist.md)**
* Extract a legible font list from your InDesign files.

**Function and Number Key to Numpad (fn_numkey_to_numpad.json)**
* Convert fn+1 to 1 (numeric keypad / numpad) for keyboards without one with [Karabiner Elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/). Installation Rules: [HERE](https://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications#testing-your-own-rules). This is modifed from the original Complex Modifications Rule called ["Numeric Keypad"](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/complex_modifications/) using Ctrl, Tab, or Caps Lock instead of Fn key.
